# LifeEngine Extended
C++ implementation of https://github.com/MaxRobinsonTheGreat/LifeEngine that extends the original version with new features.

This version is work in progress.

# Known bugs:
- Saving and loading will not work correctly unless your path contains only english letters.
- If you want to load save file made in original version, it shouldn't contain any float values or my version will crash. You can export save files with floats made in my version to the origianl though.
