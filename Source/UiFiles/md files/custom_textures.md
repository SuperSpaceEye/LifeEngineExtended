# Custom Textures
Life Engine Extended allows you to set arbitrary images as textures for organism cells, food, walls and empty space.
For image to be usable by program, it needs to be renamed to one of these titles: **("empty", "mouth", "producer", "mover", "killer", "armor", "eye", "food", "wall")** and be placed into **"/textures/"** folder.
These textures will be loaded upon program loading, or if you click **"Update textures"**.
If there is no image with type in **"/textures/"** folder, the program will revert to base texture.
The images can be of any size, but the program will stretch them to box shape.
